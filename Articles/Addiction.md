Addiction doesn't start in a vacuum. Be honest about yourself and why you have this?

A habit needs to be replaced. It's hard to cut things cold turkey. Replace the triggering activities with something else.

Willpower isn't enough. You need a systematic approach.

Change the environment. If the environment is giving you an opportunity to do the negative habit, than leave or make it so its easier to be exposed. You need to leave the house. 

Create a system of accountability, where you have to report your status.
