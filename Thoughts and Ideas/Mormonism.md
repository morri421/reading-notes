An answer to archaic rules found in older religions. Every man could have divine inspiration from God. It's an almost hedonistic religion, because it validated every base thought that a man could have as divine will. Instead of overcoming man's evil instincts, it acknowledges that those evil thoughts are because of God. It's a more honest interpretation of a higher power, in my opinion, because at least confronts the idea that God made us this way.
